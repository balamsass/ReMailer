# Implementation Log - Admin Dashboard

## Overview
Building a comprehensive admin dashboard for ReMailer with user management, audit logging, API management, and service health monitoring.

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Schema Extensions
- Added audit_logs table for tracking user actions
- Added service_health table for monitoring system status
- Extended users table with role-based permissions
- Added api_key_usage tracking

### Frontend Components
- Admin-only routes with role-based access control
- Real-time health monitoring dashboard
- Interactive charts using Recharts
- CSV export functionality for audit logs

### Backend Services
- Health check endpoints for internal/external services
- Audit logging middleware
- API rate limiting and usage tracking
- Role-based authorization middleware

- [x] Endpoint permissions

### Phase 5: Service Health Panel (45 mins)
- [x] Real-time health monitoring
- [x] Status indicators and charts
- [x] Uptime tracking
- [x] Response time monitoring

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (30 mins)
- [x] Unit tests for key components
- [x] Integration tests for API endpoints

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Recharts
- Backend: Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Auth: Session-based with role validation
- Monitoring: Real-time WebSocket updates
- Charts: Recharts for data visualization

## Security Considerations
- Admin-only access with role verification
- Audit logging for all admin actions
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Secure API key generation and storage
