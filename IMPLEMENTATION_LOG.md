# Implementation Log

## [2025-06-14]

### Tasks Completed
- Built comprehensive database schema with users, campaigns, contacts, analytics, and API tokens
- Implemented authentication system with session management and API token support
- Created main application layout with sidebar navigation matching design reference
- Built Dashboard page with metrics overview and recent campaigns table
- Implemented Campaign Builder with form controls and email editor tabs
- Created Contact Management with table view and CSV import functionality
- Built Analytics Dashboard with overview metrics and performance tracking
- Implemented API Token Management with generation and documentation

### Key Decisions
- Used Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for robust data persistence instead of in-memory storage
- Implemented both session-based auth for web UI and API token auth for programmatic access
- Chose to use shadcn/ui components for consistent design system
- Structured the app with clear separation between dashboard, campaigns, contacts, analytics, and API management
- Used React Query for efficient data fetching and cache management

### Technical Stack Choices
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Express.js + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: Session-based + API tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- State Management: React Query for server state, React hooks for client state

### Design Implementation
- Matched the provided design reference exactly including colors, layout, and component structure
- Used CSS custom properties in HSL format as required
- Implemented responsive design with proper mobile considerations
- Added proper loading states and empty states throughout the application

### Open Questions / Notes
- Email delivery integration with Mailgun/Postmark will need API keys to be configured
- WYSIWYG email editor could be enhanced with a proper rich text editor library
- Charts in analytics dashboard are placeholder - could integrate Chart.js or Recharts
- Rate limiting and API abuse prevention middleware should be added for production
- Email template management and A/B testing features identified as future enhancements
