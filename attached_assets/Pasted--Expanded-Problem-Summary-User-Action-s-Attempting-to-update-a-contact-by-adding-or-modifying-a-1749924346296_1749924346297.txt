🛑 Expanded Problem Summary
User Action(s):

Attempting to update a contact by adding or modifying a tag

Attempting to deactivate a contact using the status toggle or action menu

Observed Issues:

The new tag value is not persisted in the backend, and the UI does not reflect the change

Deactivation action also fails—the status remains "Active" and no visual or functional change occurs

Implications:
This indicates a systemic issue affecting both contact attribute updates and status toggle functionality, suggesting potential bugs in the contact update handler or UI state synchronization.

🔍 Likely Root Causes
Both issues likely stem from the same core problems, which fall into one or more of the following categories:

🔄 Backend/API Problems
Update Endpoint Not Triggered or Broken:

The API responsible for updating contact records might not be called correctly or might be discarding changes silently.

Partial Updates Not Applied:

If the backend requires full object updates and only partial fields (e.g., status or tags) are sent, the changes might be ignored.

Improper Status Enum/Field Mapping:

The "Active" status might not map correctly to a backend value (true, 1, "active", etc.), causing the update to fail validation.

🧠 Frontend State Issues
UI Not Reacting to Backend Changes:

Even if the API call succeeds, the React state might not be updated to reflect the response.

Deactivation status or tag updates might be cached or ignored if the state update handler is not properly bound to the response.

Silent Failures or Missing Error Handling:

Errors during update (e.g., 400/500 responses) may not show any alerts or logs, leading to confusion for the user.

✅ Recommended Fix Steps
🧪 Debug Actions
Inspect Network Tab (Browser DevTools):

Check if a request is fired on both tag update and deactivation click.

Ensure the request payload includes the correct data (e.g., { "status": "inactive" } or { "tags": ["test"] }).

Review response status (expect 200 OK and updated object).

Backend Logging:

Log payload received by the update endpoint.

Confirm database write is attempted and check for constraints or validation errors.

UI Debugging:

Log the response from the API after the update call.

Confirm that React state or contact list is refreshed after a successful update.

🛠 Development Fixes
Backend:

Validate that PATCH /contacts/:id correctly supports partial updates for both tags and status.

Ensure the contact model allows tags as an array of strings and status as an updatable field.

Frontend:

Add visual feedback for success or failure (toast/snackbar).

Ensure the contact list component refreshes or re-queries updated data after update actions.

Fix local state mutation or cache issues if list stays stale.

🚀 Suggested Improvements (Post-Fix)
Add confirmation modal before deactivation

Track update activity in an audit log

Show success/failure messages on tag or status change

Add auto-refresh or optimistic updates with fallback on API confirmation
