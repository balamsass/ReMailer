## CPDO Stage 1 – Problem Discovery Artifact

**Project / Initiative:** ReMailer – Lightweight Email Campaign Management App  
**Date:** 2025-06-14  
**Prepared By:** Jay Baker – Product Developer

### 1 · Problem Definition

#### 1.1 Problem Statement
Small businesses and startups lack a lightweight, affordable, and customizable solution for managing and tracking email marketing campaigns. Current platforms like Mailchimp or Constant Contact are either too complex, too expensive, or not developer-friendly.

#### 1.2 Key Statistics
- 64% of small businesses use email marketing but only 27% track performance metrics regularly
- Mailchimp’s entry-level plan costs $13+/mo, totaling over $150/year
- 74% of marketers say personalization boosts engagement

#### 1.3 Impact Dimensions
| Dimension    | Description                                |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Operational  | Manual list uploads, campaign cloning       |
| Financial    | Overspending on unused features in SaaS     |

#### 1.4 Primary Problem Drivers
- Overbuilt platforms with unused features
- No-code limitations frustrate devs
- Lack of integrated analytics

#### 1.5 Personas & Pain Points
| Persona         | Pain Point                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Startup Founder | Poor visibility and tool complexity          |
| Marketing Intern| No time-saving templates or personalization  |
| Developer       | Lack of API access or CLI customization      |

### 2 · Problem Validation

#### 2.1 Market Summary
Email remains top ROI for SMBs but tools are bloated or dev-unfriendly. Demand for developer-first campaign tools is rising.

#### 2.2 Competitor Comparison
- **Mailchimp**: Rich features, poor dev UX
- **MailerLite**: Easy to use, but limited
- **Postmark**: Dev-friendly but no campaign support

#### 2.3 ROI Justification
| Benefit        | Impact         |
|----------------|----------------|
| Time Savings   | $720/user/year |
| Cost Savings   | $150/user/year |
| Total Benefit  | $870/user/year |
